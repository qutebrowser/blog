As you all probably know already, the `crowdfunding`_ for `qutebrowser`_ ended
up being more than fully funded - thanks to everyone again!

The funds arrived on my bank account yesterday, minus some 10% fees for
Kickstarter and payment processing. Yesterday also was the last day with
lectures before my summer holidays!

Since Monday is a public `holiday`_, I decided to spend some time today on sending
out the stickers to everyone who doesn't have a t-shirt, and then continue next
Tuesday with day 2.

Over the last few days, I also spent some time on getting QtWebEngine more
ready:

- `New private browsing which supports QtWebEngine <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/086139110dc06cd3461b9b14c61a9d6f777ebe23>`_
- `Windows binaries now are built with QtWebEngine <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/misc/qutebrowser.nsi>`_
- `Using legacy QtWebKit now displays a warning <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/1c6fd6f7250063c5e2d1668afb661ab26430aa57>`_
- `Using QtWebEngine with Nouveau shows an error instead of crashing <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/67755e6f6caee61bd4611bb3fb9d01a4f84d9ea2>`_

For people who have t-shirts in their pledges, a survey will follow soon - I
still need to sort out some things about available colors and sizes first.

If you're reading this via the Python or Qt planet, note that I won't post future minor updates there - if you want updates about what I'm doing currently (a few times per week), check the `qutebrowser development blog`_!
