I (The-Compiler) am currently in Berlin - I've met with Qt/QtWebEngine
developers at Qt Contributors Summit and had some very interesting development
discussions there. There are some
`writeups <https://wiki.qt.io/Category:QtCS2019>`_ available in the Qt Wiki.

Next Thursday (28th) I'd like to have a small qutebrowser user meetup here :)
We'll meet at 19:00 in the
`AfRA Hackerspace <https://afra-berlin.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:start>`_
in Berlin Lichtenberg.

See (some of) you there, hopefully!
