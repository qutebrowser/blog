Day 8: More fixing and pytest sprint/training

(This blog post is actually a day late as I was busy packing for the pytest
sprint yesterday)

Not too much exciting stuff this time - I mostly continued working on getting
basic stuff like scrolling and zooming to work after the refactoring, and added
a temporary fix for ``:navigate`` and hinting until I get to rewriting them for
QtWebEngine.

**************************
pytest sprint and training
**************************

For the rest of this month, I won't be working on qutebrowser much, as I'll be
at the `pytest sprint`_ in Freiburg. However, I plan to work on various things
I need in qutebrowser's testsuite too!

After the sprint, 27th to 29th, I'll host a professional `training`_ for
`pytest`_, `tox`_ and `devpi`_ in Freiburg. If you'd like to join as well,
there are still free spaces!

My "office"

Some people wondered if I'm working from home - to avoid distractions, I'm
actually using the local `hackerspace`_ as my "office". Here's how it looks:
