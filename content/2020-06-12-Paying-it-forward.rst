Paying it forward

:category: other

As mentioned in my `last post`_, I'm earning what's basically a small part-time
income from qutebrowser donations - thanks again to everyone who's donating
money, it means a lot!

To pay it forward, I decided to donate to some of the projects qutebrowser is
relying on:

- 3$ per month (indefinitely) to `Ned Batchelder`_ of `coverage.py`_
- 1$ per month (indefinitely) to the `Homebrew`_ package manager for macOS
- 50$ to `Pallets`_, the organization behind Flask and Jinja2
- 50$ to the `Python Software Foundation`_
- 42€ to `Hartmut Goebel`_ of `PyInstaller`_
- 15€ to `mgedmin`_ of `check-manifest`_

If your own project relies on libraries taking donations and you can afford to
do so, I'd encourage you to do the same! It doesn't have to be a lot: As I've
experienced with qutebrowser, a lot of small donations can make a big
difference.
