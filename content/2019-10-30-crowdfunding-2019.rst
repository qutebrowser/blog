I'm very happy to announce that the next qutebrowser crowdfunding went live
today! \o/

This time, I'm focused on recurring donations via GitHub Sponsors. Those
donations will allow me to work part-time on qutebrowser! Thanks to the GitHub
Matching Fund, all donations (up to $5000 in the first year) will be doubled.

Just like in the 2017/2018 crowdfundings, it'll be possible to get t-shirts and
stickers again. I'll also add some new swag to the mix :)

You can find all details on my `GitHub Sponsors page <https://github.com/sponsors/The-Compiler/>`_
and the `FAQ I've written <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/faq.asciidoc#sponsors>`_.

I'm excited for what's to come! If you run into any trouble or have questions,
please `let me know <mailto:mail@qutebrowser.org>`_.
