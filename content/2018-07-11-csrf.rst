possible for websites to modify qutebrowser settings. Via settings like
``editor.command``, this possibly allowed websites to execute arbitrary code.

This issue has been assigned `CVE-2018-10895 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10895>`_.

Timeline
********

2018-07-09: I was made aware of the original issue privately (initially
believed by the reporter to only be a DoS issue), developed a fix and contacted
the distros Openwall mailinglist to organize a disclosure date to give
distributions time to coordinate releasing of a fix.

2018-07-10: Slightly updated patch sent to the distros mailinglist.

2018-07-11: Public disclosure.

**********
Mitigation
**********

Please upgrade to v1.4.1 or apply the patches above.

Note that disabling loading of ``autoconfig.yml`` is not a suitable remedy, since
settings are still applied until the next restart.

As a workaround, it's possible to patch out the vulnerable code via a
``config.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    from qutebrowser.browser import qutescheme
    qutescheme._qute_settings_set = lambda url: ('text/html', '')

While there is no known exploit for this in the wild, users are advised to
check their ``autoconfig.yml`` file (located in the config folder shown in
``:version``) for any unwanted modifications.
