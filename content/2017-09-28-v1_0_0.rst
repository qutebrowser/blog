qutebrowser v1.0.0 is coming closer
###################################

:category: other

just a quick update to let you know that the last one of four big changes is
now done:

- [x] The new completion, based on sqlite
- [x] The new config system
- [x] Dropping legacy support
- [x] **Making QtWebEngine the default backend**

If QtWebEngine can't be used on your system for some reason, you'll get a
message about it. If it can, it'll automatically use that unless you set the
"backend" setting to "webkit".

I still hope to get v1.0.0 with all this out in mid-November, before
Firefox 57 is released - if possible, with some initial form of per-domain
settings!

If you find any issues or need help, please let me know!
