T-Shirts shipped, initial implementation of per-domain settings
###############################################################

:category: config

Last Saturday, I finally managed to ship all t-shirts with some much appreciated
help from a friend and my SO! You should hopefully get yours soon (I'd imagine
starting today for people from Germany). **I'd really appreciate it if you could
send me a quick mail (mail@qutebrowser.org) or ping me on IRC (#qutebrowser on
Freenode) if yours arrived** (and in what country you are).That helps me to keep
track of how things look, since all shirts are sent without tracking.

We ended up bringing a big ~18kg parcel to the post office containing 55
envelopes:

As usual, not everything went quite to plan - here's a list of the mistakes we
thankfully caught:

- I accidentally discarded a sheet of labels which still had three labels on it.
  This was caught by counting the envelopes at the end, and easy to re-print.
- Someone almost got a lady-cut M instead of a regular-cut one. Really glad we
  caught that one before it was too late.
- The glue on the padded envelopes didn't really hold well, so one opened while
  we were handling them. It turns out others were really close to opening as
  well - we were really lucky this happened while they were still at our place,
  and fixed it with some additional tape.
- It turns out a "big letter" shipped worldwide has a bigger maximum size than
  the same thing to Germany - there, a "maxi letter" is apparently needed. We
  only found out at the post office, and had to put some additional stamps on
  there - thankfully, this was only on 8 envelopes going to Germany.
- While I `wrote some code`_ to add additional text to the labels telling us what
  to pack (which streamlined things extremely compared to last year!), I forgot
  that I promised 10/15/20 stickers depending on the pledge levels. The ones
  with 20 stickers were easy to find (as they have two t-shirts), for others
  there was a pragmatic solution: Simply giving 15 stickers to everyone :)

I do hope everything else went according to plan, but if something is wrong with
what you got, please contact me.

I've also been hard at work on per-domain settings, and I have a first prototype
to show:

It's in the `per-url branch`_, but not quite ready yet - if you want to try it,
make sure to make a backup of your config directory first. As you can see, it
requires a reload to apply the settings currently. I'll look into avoiding that
where possible, but I can't quite tell yet to what extend that will be possible.
