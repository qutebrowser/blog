*Just like in the 2017/2018 crowdfundings, it'll be possible to get t-shirts and stickers again. I'll also add some new swag to the mix :)*

Just a quick reminder: If you want physical rewards with the current perk
levels, sign up to the `GitHub Sponsors campaign <https://github.com/sponsors/The-Compiler/>`_
before the end of the year.

Somewhen after 2020 comes around the corner (and probably after my birthday on
the 2nd) I'm going to adjust the perks accordingly.
